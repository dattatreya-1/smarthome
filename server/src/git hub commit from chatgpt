Add clients UI and API integration with PostgreSQL backend
### Overview
This update integrates the frontend client management UI with the backend API and PostgreSQL database. It also introduces a lightweight CORS configuration for local development to allow smooth interaction between the client (port 8080) and the Express API (port 5000).

### Changes Implemented
- **Frontend (client/index.html)**
  - Added form to create and list clients.
  - Updated API base URL to point to backend service (http://localhost:5000/api).
  - Improved client table rendering and error handling.

- **Backend (server/src)**
  - Implemented `GET /api/clients` and `POST /api/clients` endpoints.
  - Connected Express backend to PostgreSQL using the `pg` Pool.
  - Added `server/src/db.js` for DB connection configuration.
  - Enabled simple CORS middleware for local development in `index.js`.
  - Dockerfile and Compose setup updated to include PostgreSQL container and persistent data volume.

- **Docker Configuration**
  - Added `docker-compose.yml` to manage server, client, and database services.
  - Verified container networking and local database initialization.

### Testing
- Verified server and database connectivity using:
  - `curl http://localhost:5000/api/clients`
  - Frontend form submission at `http://localhost:8080/`
- Confirmed successful client record insertion and retrieval.

### Next Steps
- Add PUT/DELETE endpoints for client management.
- Secure CORS configuration for production.
- Integrate authentication and improved error handling.

✅ **Result:** Full client creation and listing now functional from the SmartHome web UI, backed by PostgreSQL.
